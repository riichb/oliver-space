Project was created using React App. 
 
I was having problems with using repl.it

Thoughts during the excercise:
- For the list of users I was debating whether to to <tables> or <li>. I ended up using <tables> because i felt it was more semantic even though tables sucks. 
- 

Things That I wanted to do:
- Add React router to handle the routing when clicking a users information
- Create a UserInfo Component
- Finish styling. It is very bare bones. Was going to add additional styling and use a couple of flex styles.
